# enginefail
Engine fail script for FiveM 

Allows use of commands /failengine [1-2] and /failallengines [1-2] to fail the engines of planes
First command fails one engine in the plane 
Second fails all engines 
Using the number 1 next to any command produces a puff of smoke and the engine still works (RP purposes)
Using the number 2 next to any command produces dark smoke, a fire and explosion (Engine and surrounding area are damaged randomly based on the explosion)

/repairengine fixes all engines and removes fire and smoke


Note: Don't fail an engine twice in a row or the plane will probably explode, if you want to fail engines again first repair engines with the command and then fail them again. This should work with all addon planes that have engine bones.

Made for FiveM
